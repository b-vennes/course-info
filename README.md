# Pluralsight Course Info

Project developed along with the [Building an Application Using Java SE 17](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/java-se-17-building-application) course.

I've improved the course code with usage of the [Project Reactor](https://projectreactor.io/) functional streaming library.

## Build

```bash
mvn clean compile
```

## Test

```bash
mvn clean test
```

## Package

```bash
mvn clean package
```
